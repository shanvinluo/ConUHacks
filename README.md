Used the Tesseract library's OCR (Optical Character Recognition) features to create a primitive receipt scanner.
This primitive scanner is the first step and a sample that could potentially be developed into a receipt scanner mobile application. 
This project was tackled by first-year undergraduates during the 24h hackathon ConUHacksVII in 2023.
